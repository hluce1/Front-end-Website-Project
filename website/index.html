                        The Tocumwal Archive is a collection of stories and photographs, about living in the houses that were moved from the Tocumwal 
                        air force base in New South Wales, to the Canberra suburb of O'Connor.  
                     </p>
                     <p class="content">
                        The base was built during the Second World War as an inland 
                        defence against Japanese invasion. As camouflage, the sleeping quarters for air force personnel were built in the form of houses. 
                        After the War.

                        After the bombing of Darwin, the United States of America and Australia made joint plans for Australian inland defence. The Tocumwal airfield was the largest and first of several large airfields planned for construction in relation to the the line of possible Japanese advance. (contributed 2000)

                        I remember seeing houses in sections going along the highway on big trucks. The Murray Valley Highway was really narrow and they seemed to take up all of the road. I knew they came from Tocumwal but I didn't know where they were going.  (contributed 1996)

                        My family was aware of Tocumwal and its houses long before they became a feature of the streets of O'Connor. My father, Hartley Hollier, was a serving member of the RAAF from 1936-46 and was actually stationed at Tocumwal. (contributed 1996)

                        We arrived in Australia in 1966 and bought this house in Quinn Street, O'Connor. The house, a Tocumwal type, had a huge back yard. There were all types of fruit trees, pencil pines and nut trees growing. But it was the large block off the beaten track that attracted me. (contriubted 1996)
