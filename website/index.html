                        The Tocumwal Archive is a collection of stories and photographs, about living in the houses that were moved from the Tocumwal 
                        air force base in New South Wales, to the Canberra suburb of O'Connor.  
                     </p>
                     <p class="content">
                        The base was built during the Second World War as an inland 
                        defence against Japanese invasion. As camouflage, the sleeping quarters for air force personnel were built in the form of houses. 
                        After the War.

                        in NSW for the US Army Air Corps were re-erected in the ACT.
